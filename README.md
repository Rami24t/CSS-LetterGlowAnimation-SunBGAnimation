Let's try to recreate the lighting animation shown below:

![example](img/mockup.gif)

## Objectives / Info

- You'll need to use `@keyframes` and create a custom animation.
- `text-shadow` and `animation-delay` might be useful for this.
- Reference the [Style Guide](style-guide.md) for fonts, colors, etc...
- Try to make it as close to the example as possible.
- Have fun 🐱‍🚀
